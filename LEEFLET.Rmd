# Scope of the assignment

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!


```{r}

library(leaflet)

my_map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  
  addMarkers(lng=81.788261, lat=17.010181)
my_map 

```
